This is an incipient project of a complete beginner in all things coding. 

It is intended to be a cleaning app, although its function primarily is to showcase my sklls in building CRUD applications. 

There are three branches: dev, staging and prod. 

We are currently (June 2024) firmly mired in the dev stage, so this project is not very fleshed out yet. 

The DEV stage will be built primarily around very simple components: I use the built-in Django application server, a dedicated Postgres database which resides on my own network, and basically host the whole thing from my own computer. 

For staging, I would like to start dockerising components and ensure I have a server like Apache or Nginx set up. 

For prod, the project will be hosted on a domain I own for demonstration purposes (I do not yet work as a back-end developer -- becoming one is my ultimate aim) and should then have all the trimmings of being containerised, with a good server/caching set-up etc.

Licence is GPL, so completely open-source.
